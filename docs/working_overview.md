## 💡 Project Overview

Welcome to our project, developed as part of the **Landbot Frontend Challenge**! 🚀 The goal was to create a versatile application that allows users to interact with different bots based on their specific needs, leveraging the powerful capabilities of the `@landbot/core` library.

### 🎯 Challenge Objective

Implementing a conversational experience can be tricky. With the latest release of `@landbot/core`, creating a conversational interface or a sequential messaging use case has become more accessible. Our mission was to utilize this tool to develop a unique chat UI or a small website widget with onboarding capabilities, all built with **React**.

### 🛠️ What We Built

We designed a small app that lets users enter and receive assistance from various bots tailored to their requirements. This application serves as a foundation for creating custom conversational experiences, enhancing user engagement and streamlining interactions.
